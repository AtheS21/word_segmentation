== Baseline Model README

= Files
A Conditional Random Field (CRF) model is implemented using several files:

  crf.py: The top level code to run the entire train / test / evaluate process.

  crf_formatter.py: Code to convert the original dataset to a tagged format, and vice versa.

  features.py: Defines the model's features. Relies on code provided by CRFSuite.

  crfutils.py, template.py: Code provided by CRFSuite to aid in defining features.

The code has comments to describe the code and different file formats.

= Required Libraries
The CRF model requires the CRFSuite library to run. Please follow the instructions
found at http://www.chokkan.org/software/crfsuite/manual.html#id489766 to install
CRFSuite on your machine. Also note that CRFSuite requires liblbfgs, found at
http://www.chokkan.org/software/liblbfgs/.

= Running
Once CRFSuite is installed, to run the training, testing, and evaluation with default files,
use the command:
	
	python crf.py

Non-default filenames can be passed in as command-line arguments.

The training takes ~45 minutes on a MacBook Pro. 

= Output
At the end, a segmented file is created (default is output/predictions.utf8)
and the scoring result will be printed to STDOUT.

The included model results in a score of 0.926 precision, 0.916 f-measure, 0.907 recall, (0.916 average).

= Commented Version
Code is commented-out in three different areas. The commented versions are found in:
  crf_commented.py           (the commands to run CRFSuite)
  crf_formatter_commented.py (formatting functions)
  features_commented.py      (defining feature templates and feature functions)
